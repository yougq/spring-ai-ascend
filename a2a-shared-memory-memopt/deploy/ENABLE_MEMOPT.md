# Enabling MemOpt under A2A shared memory

The A2A shared-memory kit ([`a2a-shared-memory`](../../a2a-shared-memory)) has two
layers — a run-scoped *blackboard* (in-memory by design) and a cross-run
*experience* layer. By default the experience layer is in-memory and lost on
restart. **MemOpt** gives it persistent, semantic memory. This bundle lets you turn
that on **on demand**, without building or seeing the MemOpt engine source.

```

                      ▼
        MemOpt engine  ◀── closed container image (this bundle runs it) ──▶ NATS
```

## What you get / don't need

- **You don't build or get the MemOpt source.** MemOpt ships as a **closed image**;
  its Python source + Dockerfile live in the MemOpt repo. You only **pull and run**
  the image here.
- This module (`a2a-shared-memory-memopt`) is the **Java HTTP client** to it — plain
  JDK `HttpClient`, no MemOpt types.

## Prerequisites

- Docker (Compose v2). On macOS, Colima with the `vz` VM type works well.
- Access to the MemOpt image in your registry (ask the platform team for the tag),
  **or** a locally-built `memopt:<tag>`.
- LLM gateway credentials the engine calls (`GATEWAY_BASE_URL`, `GATEWAY_API_KEY`,
  `DEFAULT_MODEL`).

## Enable (3 steps)

```bash
cd a2a-shared-memory-memopt/deploy
cp .env.example .env          # set MEMOPT_IMAGE (your registry tag) + GATEWAY_*
./enable-memopt.sh            # brings up MemOpt + NATS, waits for /healthz, prints wiring
```

`./enable-memopt.sh` runs `docker compose up -d` (engine image + NATS + persistent
volumes) and verifies `GET /healthz`. Tear down with `docker compose down` (add `-v`
to also drop the memory volumes).

## Wire the A2A shared-memory experience layer to it

Point the kit's `ExperienceStore` at the running engine:

```java
ExperienceStore experience = new MemOptExperienceStore(
        "http://<memopt-host>:8077",
        new MemOptExperienceStore.Options(
                Duration.ofSeconds(2), /*failOpen*/ true, 5, 30_000L,
                System.getenv("MEMOPT_FACADE_AUTH_TOKEN")));  // null/blank => no auth header
```

Then hand that store to the A2A shared-memory experience kit (see
[`../README.md`](../README.md)). The client **fails open**: if MemOpt is slow or
down, recall returns empty and the agent path is never blocked.

## Security & persistence

- **Auth.** Set `MEMOPT_FACADE_AUTH_TOKEN` (in `.env`) whenever MemOpt is reachable
  beyond localhost; the kit must send the same token (the `authToken` above).
  `/healthz` + `/metrics` stay open for liveness/scrape.
- **TLS.** Terminate TLS at an ingress and use an `https://` base URL.
- **Persistence.** The compose mounts named volumes (`memopt_chroma/data/state/memory`)
  so memory survives restarts.
- **No secrets in files.** Gateway creds and the token come from `.env` (uncommitted),
  not from the compose file.

## Where the image comes from

The image is built from the MemOpt repo (`docs/DEPLOY_CONTAINER.md` there) and pushed
to your registry; set `MEMOPT_IMAGE` accordingly. If you built it locally, the default
`memopt:0.0.1` tag works on that host.
