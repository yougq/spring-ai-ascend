# spring-ai-ascend

> Enterprise agent platform on Spring AI 2.0.0-M5 + Spring Boot 4.0.5 + Java 21 — as of v2.0.0-rc13 (2026-05-20 L0 architecture ratchet: dissolve agent-runtime-core per ADR-0088 + lock client→bus→server ingress per ADR-0089; reactor 9→8 modules; new Rule R-I sub-clause .b + gate Rule 105 edge_no_direct_compute_link).

## What is this?

`spring-ai-ascend` is a self-hostable agent runtime for financial-services teams. It ships a dual-mode orchestration kernel — deterministic graph state machines and ReAct-style agent loops sharing a single interrupt primitive — with audit-grade evidence, posture-aware fail-closed defaults, and an OSS-first integration model. Build on top of it the same way you would build on Spring Boot itself: pull in the BoM, write `@Bean` overrides for the SPI surface you need, and ship.

## Status

**L1 module-level architecture shipped.** W0 runtime kernel + L1 platform composition (JWT validation, tenant claim cross-check, durable idempotency, posture boot guard, W1 run HTTP API, high-cardinality metric scrub, Rule R-C.a Code-as-Contract governance) shipped; W2–W4 capabilities remain design contracts.

## Quick start

```bash
./mvnw -T 1C verify
```

`verify` (not `test`) is the canonical command — `test` skips the `*IT.java` enforcers, several of which are ship-blocking under Rule D-5. `-T 1C` builds independent reactor modules in parallel; surefire runs JUnit classes concurrently inside each fork (toggle with `-DjunitParallel=false`); failsafe runs IT classes sequentially within a fork (Spring Boot 4.0.5 isn't thread-safe at `SpringApplication.run()`).

Posture is selected by the `APP_POSTURE` environment variable (`dev` / `research` / `prod`). `dev` is permissive (in-memory backends allowed, missing config emits WARN); `research` and `prod` fail-closed at startup if required config is missing.

## Modules — six-team-facing-modules materialization (Phase C + engine extraction complete)

The L0 architecture (CLAUDE.md P-A..P-M) declares **six team-facing modules**.
Phase C (ADR-0078, 2026-05-18) consolidated the prior `agent-platform` + `agent-runtime` into `agent-service`. The reactor now ships **8 Maven modules** = 6 team-facing substantive modules + BoM + graphmemory starter (rc13 dissolved the transient `agent-runtime-core` module per ADR-0088 and redistributed its sources to the modules that semantically own them: runs/idempotency → `agent-service`; orchestration SPI + RunMode → `agent-execution-engine.engine.orchestration.spi`; s2c SPI → `agent-bus.bus.spi.s2c`). Paired with ADR-0089 (2026-05-20), `agent-bus` also hosts the new `bus.spi.ingress.IngressGateway` SPI — the client-to-server cross-plane control surface; together with s2c the Bus & State Hub plane owns cross-plane traffic in both directions.

| Module | Plane (P-I) | Owner team | Maturity today |
|--------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| `agent-client` | Edge Access | AgentClient | skeleton (SDK; W3+ per ADR-0049). All cross-plane traffic locked to `bus.spi.ingress.IngressGateway` per ADR-0089 / Rule R-I.b |
| `agent-service` | Compute & Control | AgentService | shipped — HTTP edge (`service.platform.*`) + cognitive runtime kernel (`service.runtime.*`) + Run / RunStateMachine / IdempotencyRecord (re-consolidated per ADR-0088); owns `GraphMemoryRepository` / `ResilienceContract` / `SkillCapacityRegistry` / `RunRepository` SPIs |
| `agent-middleware` | Compute & Control | Middleware | shipped — RuntimeMiddleware SPI + HookDispatcher extracted from runtime per ADR-0073 |
| `agent-execution-engine` | Compute & Control | AgentExecutionEngine | shipped — engine adapter SPI (`engine.spi`: ExecutorAdapter, GraphExecutor, AgentLoopExecutor, EngineHookSurface) + orchestration SPI (`engine.orchestration.spi`: RunMode, Checkpointer, Orchestrator, RunContext, SuspendSignal, TraceContext, ExecutorDefinition — relocated per ADR-0088) + EngineRegistry + EngineEnvelope |
| `agent-bus` | Bus & State Hub | AgentBus | shipped — cross-plane control surfaces in BOTH directions: `bus.spi.ingress.IngressGateway` (ADR-0089) + `bus.spi.s2c.S2cCallbackTransport` (ADR-0088). Workflow primitives W2 per ADR-0050 |
| `agent-evolve` | Evolution | AgentEvolve | skeleton (Python ML pipeline; Java adapter deferred) |
| `spring-ai-ascend-dependencies` | (build-time) | platform | shipped (BoM) |
| `spring-ai-ascend-graphmemory-starter` | Bus & State Hub | AgentBus | shipped (graphmemory SPI scaffold; ADR-0034) |

Per-module `module-metadata.yaml` is the authoritative identity + dependency
declaration. Per-module `ARCHITECTURE.md` carries the L1 view. Per-module
`docs/dfx/<module>.yaml` declares the five DFX dimensions (Rule R-D sub-clause .a).

### Five-plane topology (P-I)

Each module is pinned to exactly one of five deployment planes. Workloads
with different runtime characteristics MUST NOT share infrastructure — see
`docs/governance/principle-coverage.yaml` for the principle ↔ rule map and
`docs/governance/bus-channels.yaml` for the three-track channel isolation
that protects the Bus & State Hub plane.

### Three-track bus channel isolation (P-E / Rule R-E)

Cross-service internal traffic is sliced into three physically isolated
channels declared in `docs/governance/bus-channels.yaml`:

| Channel | Cargo | Priority |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `control` | PAUSE / KILL / CANCEL intents | highest — never blocks for `data` congestion |
| `data` | run payload bodies (≤16 KiB inline cap §4 #13) | normal |
| `rhythm` | heartbeat / liveness pulses | lowest — drops oldest if saturated |

### W2.x heterogeneous engine contract

The engine surface is a structured contract: `docs/contracts/engine-envelope.v1.yaml`
governs registration / matching / observability; engines fire canonical
`HookPoint` events declared in `docs/contracts/engine-hooks.v1.yaml`; the
server-to-client capability protocol uses `docs/contracts/s2c-callback.v1.yaml`;
the evolution-scope discriminator lives in
`docs/governance/evolution-scope.v1.yaml`. Authority: Rules 43–48 +
ADR-0071..0077. Release note:
[docs/logs/releases/2026-05-16-W2x-engine-contract-wave.en.md](docs/logs/releases/2026-05-16-W2x-engine-contract-wave.en.md).

## Integration paths

| Path | When to use | Entry point |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Drop-in `@Bean` override | You implement `GraphMemoryRepository`; starter auto-config wires it | `spring-ai-ascend-graphmemory-starter` |
| Direct Spring AI / Spring Data | Use `ChatMemory`, `VectorStore`, `CrudRepository` directly without starters | No starter needed |
| BoM import only | Pin SDK + OSS versions; manage wiring yourself | `spring-ai-ascend-dependencies` BoM |

## Runtime model

`Run.mode` discriminates `GRAPH` (deterministic state machine) from `AGENT_LOOP` (ReAct-style LLM reasoning). Both modes share one interrupt primitive — `SuspendSignal` — which the `Orchestrator` catches to checkpoint the parent, dispatch a child Run, and resume the parent with the child's result. Three-level bidirectional nesting (graph → agent-loop → graph) is proved by `NestedDualModeIT`.

The full architectural constraint set (§4 #1–#63) and the deferred-capability roadmap (W1–W4) live in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and [docs/governance/architecture-status.yaml](docs/governance/architecture-status.yaml). They are not duplicated here.

## Posture model

| Posture | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `dev` (default) | Permissive — in-memory backends allowed; missing config emits WARN, not exception |
| `research` | Fail-closed — required config present or `IllegalStateException`; durable persistence expected |
| `prod` | Fail-closed — same as research; stricter enforcement planned for W2 |
