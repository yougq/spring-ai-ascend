 * Federation Gateway SPI per ADR-0101 (rc26) Mode B Business-Centric
 * deployment.
 *
 * <p>Distinguishes in-process (Mode A) vs networked (Mode B) ingress
 * routing. In Mode A this delegates to the local in-process
 * {@link com.huawei.ascend.bus.spi.ingress.IngressGateway}. In Mode B
 * it forwards eligible requests across the network to the platform
 * Federation Hub.
 *
 * <p>Federation broker technology choice (Kafka / NATS / in-house) is
 * deferred to a separate future ADR per ADR-0101 §non_goals. This SPI
 * is broker-agnostic.
 *
 * <p>The in-process bus shim on the business side (Mode B) implements
 * the same {@link com.huawei.ascend.bus.spi.ingress.IngressGateway}
 * SPI; this FederationGateway is the cross-network forwarding layer
 * that wraps it.
 *
 * <p>SPI purity per Rule R-D: imports only {@code java.*} + own
 * siblings + {@code bus.spi.ingress} carrier types.
