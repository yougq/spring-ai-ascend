# `agent-service` — L1 Feature Catalog (9-section)

This catalog is the **rendered** human-readable view of the
`agent-service`-owned features registered in
[`architecture/features/features.dsl`](../../../../features/features.dsl).
The structured source is the DSL; this Markdown is byte-identical
on re-emit. The 9 sections follow the user-supplied L1 Feature
Catalog template (ADR-0151).

## 3. Functional Decomposition

This module's features and their function-point membership are wired
by `contains` relationships in
[`architecture/features/features.dsl`](../../../../features/features.dsl).

function-point inventory.

  under `feat... -> fp... "contains"` relationships in features.dsl.

## 4. Contract Surface

Runtime promise surfaces touched by this module's features. For the
full catalog, see
[`docs/contracts/contract-catalog.md`](../../../../../docs/contracts/contract-catalog.md).

## 5. Runtime Behavior

### `FEAT-ENGINE-DISPATCH-AND-HOOKS`

Owns the engine boundary: every Run dispatch goes through EngineRegistry.resolve(envelope) against engine-envelope.v1.yaml; pattern-matching on ExecutorDefinition subtypes outside the registry is forbidden (Rule R-M.a). Cross-cutting policies (model gateway, tool authz, memory governance, tenant policy, quota, observability, sandbox routing, checkpoint, failure handling) are expressed as RuntimeMiddleware listening on canonical HookPoint events from engine-hooks.v1.yaml. The hook contract is the extension surface for new policies without modifying executors.

### `FEAT-IDEMPOTENCY-AND-REPLAY`

Owns idempotency at the public API boundary: IdempotencyHeaderFilter extracts the Idempotency-Key header and consults IdempotencyStore (Postgres-backed, NOT NULL + UNIQUE on (tenantId, key)) to either claim a fresh slot or replay the stored response. The store carries the response envelope so replay is byte-identical without re-executing the Run. Tenant isolation is enforced at the storage engine (Rule R-J).

### `FEAT-POSTURE-BOOTSTRAP`

Owns posture-aware startup: PostureBootGuard validates @RequiredConfig-annotated configuration properties before the runtime accepts traffic. In research and prod postures the boot fails closed on missing config; in dev posture it logs and allows. Posture is determined by spring.profiles.active; the guard runs in @Order(0) so misconfiguration surfaces before any framework wiring. Default posture is dev when unset, per the explicit fail-loud-on-prod-misconfig discipline of Rule D-6.

### `FEAT-RUN-LIFECYCLE-CONTROL`

Owns the public Run lifecycle surface — POST /v1/runs admission with tenant + idempotency + posture guard, POST /v1/runs/{id}/cancel re-validation and DFA transition to CANCEL_REQUESTED, GET /v1/runs/{id} tenant-scoped polling, GET /v1/runs paginated listing, and the CAS-based RunRepository.updateIfNotTerminal atomic transition that backs all of them. Run state changes are protected by the DFA in RunStateMachine; every persisted Run carries tenantId enforced by NOT NULL + RLS. Public endpoint behavior described by openapi-v1.yaml.

### `FEAT-SUSPEND-RESUME-CONTROL`

Owns Run-level suspension and resume: SuspendSignal sealed-type variants (forClientCallback, forChildRun, forRateLimit, forCheckpoint) cause Run to transition to SUSPENDED with a typed SuspendReason; ResumeDispatcher transitions back to RUNNING when the suspension condition resolves. Child-run spawn is a SuspendSignal variant — parent suspends until child reaches terminal state. The full state machine is encoded in RunStateMachine and validated by every persisted transition.

### `FEAT-TENANT-ISOLATION`

Owns tenant isolation across the surface: every tenant-scoped HTTP request cross-checks JWT.tenant claim against the IngressEnvelope.tenantId (Rule R-J); every tenant-bearing Flyway migration enables Postgres Row-Level Security on the same migration (Rule R-J.a); cross-tenant access at the cancel endpoint collapses to 404 not_found at W0 (deferred 403 widening per ADR-0108). The tenant contract is enforced at three layers: HTTP edge, repository layer, and storage engine.

## 6. DFX Requirements

DFX dimensions for `agent-service` are declared in
[`docs/dfx/agent-service.yaml`](../../../../../docs/dfx/agent-service.yaml).
Per-feature DFX deltas (if any) are tracked alongside the FEAT-
element in `architecture/features/features.dsl`.

## 7. AI Execution Boundary

Machine-readable AI boundary per feature (5 saa.aiBoundary.* sub-keys).
AI agents acting on this module MUST consult these before auto-modifying:

## 9. Lifecycle / Governance

Feature lifecycle state machine (Rule G-14):

```
proposed -> accepted -> design_only -> ready_for_impl
                                    -> implemented_unverified
                                    -> test_verified -> shipped
                                    -> deprecated -> removed
```

Current state per feature:

- `FEAT-ENGINE-DISPATCH-AND-HOOKS` — `shipped`
- `FEAT-IDEMPOTENCY-AND-REPLAY` — `shipped`
- `FEAT-POSTURE-BOOTSTRAP` — `shipped`
- `FEAT-RUN-LIFECYCLE-CONTROL` — `shipped`
- `FEAT-SUSPEND-RESUME-CONTROL` — `shipped`
- `FEAT-TENANT-ISOLATION` — `shipped`

Status transitions are governed by Rule G-14 (advisory at W1, blocking
at W5 after soak). Forward-only by default; backward transitions
require an ADR `extends:` or `relates_to:` the feature's source ADR.
