# Architecture Workspace

`architecture/workspace.dsl` is `唯一主入口` (THE sole main entry) for the entire architecture design system. Every architecture-design conversation starts here. The workspace closure carries the architecture's structure, contracts, decisions, and human-readable narrative as one coherent body.

> **Status (Wave 8 shipped, 2026-05-27):** the workspace gate is BLOCKING since W5; the L1 design corpus is consolidated under `architecture/docs/L1/` since W8; module-root `agent-*/ARCHITECTURE.md` files are merged into the L1 corpus; `!docs docs` + `!adrs decisions` directives are wired so Structurizr formally imports the narrative + ADR markdowns.

## What workspace.dsl carries

| Structurizr concept | Spring AI Ascend role |
|---|---|
| `softwareSystem` / `container` / `component` | L1 architecture structure (8 Maven modules + their components) |
| `element` + tags + properties | Feature / Capability / FunctionPoint instances (`SAA Capability`, `SAA Feature`, `SAA FunctionPoint` tags) |
| `->` relationship + `saa.rel` property | dependency / implements / verifies / constrains / declares_spi / contains / decides edges |
| `!docs docs` | imports `architecture/docs/` as the workspace's human-readable companion |
| `!adrs decisions` | imports `architecture/decisions/<id>.md` (mirrored from `docs/adr/`) as decision records |
| `views {}` | 4+1 organisation form — `systemContext`, `container`, `component`, `dynamic`, `deployment` views |

## Reading path

Newcomers (human or AI) reach an unbiased architecture picture by reading in this order:

1. **`architecture/facts/generated/`** — machine-extracted factual ground truth: code symbols, contract operations, tests, module dependencies, runtime config, ADR graph. AI agents read THIS BEFORE prose for any factual claim. Populated by the deterministic extractors under `tools/architecture-workspace/.../facts/` (Fact-Layer Round-1 Waves 2-4 shipped 2026-05-27; Round-2 Wave A truth-up shipped 2026-05-28). See [`architecture/facts/README.md`](facts/README.md) for the wave-status table.
2. **`architecture/workspace.dsl`** — the architecture's structure as DSL. Parses everything below into one model.
3. **`architecture/README.md`** (this file) — navigation of the closure + DSL conventions.
4. **`architecture/docs/L1/README.md`** — L1 module entry index. Pick the module you're working on.
5. **`architecture/features/function-points.dsl`** — L1 function-point inventory (who implements what, what verifies it).
6. **`docs/adr/<id>-*.yaml`** — decision rationale for any edge you traverse.

Adjacent surfaces (not architecture-design but operationally needed):

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — enforceable rule kernels (Layer-0 principles + Layer-1 rules); read when you need to know "which rule does this enforce?"
- **`architecture/docs/L0/ARCHITECTURE.md`** (root) — declarative L0 system boundary + 65 §4 constraints; read when you need the platform-level constraint corpus.
- **`docs/contracts/`** — runtime contract surface (OpenAPI, engine envelope, hooks, S2C callback, etc.); read when you need the contract a module commits to at runtime.
- **`docs/quickstart.md`** — boot-and-first-run; read when you need to run the platform.

## DSL conventions (verified 2026-05-27)

- The DSL keyword for custom elements is `element` (NOT `customElement`).
- `Model.getElements()` in structurizr-dsl 6.2.1 INCLUDES CustomElements; `ProfileValidator` walks it exactly once.
- Identifier scope is the default `flat` (top-level identifiers are globally unique; nested-container short identifiers can be referenced from model-block-level relationships).
- Multi-word tags are one quoted string (`"SAA Module"`); the tags list is comma-separated.
- Property keys can be dotted (`"saa.id" "value"`); quote both name and value for safety.
- DSL string literals must escape `{` and `}` (use `(` `)` in relationship descriptions).
- DSL relationship blocks require multi-line `properties { ... }`; single-line form `{ "k" "v" }` fails parsing.
- `!include` order is significant — a fragment cannot reference identifiers defined in a later-included file.

## Authored vs generated zone

| Zone | Path | Edit by | Drift prevented by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Authored | `architecture/workspace.dsl` root + `features/` + `docs/L1/` + `decisions/` + `facts/README.md` + `facts/schema/` + `profile/saa-property-authority.yaml` | humans (or programmatic mount with explicit run) | profile validator + Rule G-1.b + Rule G-15.a |
| Generated DSL | `architecture/generated/*.dsl` | machine emitters in `tools/architecture-workspace/.../fragment/` | byte-identical regeneration gate (Rule G-13.b) |
| Generated Facts | `architecture/facts/generated/*.json` | deterministic extractors in `tools/architecture-workspace/.../facts/` (Waves 2-5) | byte-identical regeneration + provenance + LLM-no-author gate (Rule G-15.b/.c) |

## Running the tools

```bash
# Validate the workspace parses + conforms to the profile:
./mvnw -f tools/architecture-workspace/pom.xml exec:java \
  -Dexec.args="validate architecture/workspace.dsl"

# Emit normalized JSON (for downstream consumers):
./mvnw -f tools/architecture-workspace/pom.xml exec:java \
  -Dexec.args="normalize architecture/workspace.dsl out/architecture/normalized-model.json"

# Re-emit the 7 generated zone fragments:
java -cp tools/architecture-workspace/target/classes:$(cat /tmp/cp.txt) \
  com.huawei.ascend.tools.architecture.fragment.AllFragmentsCli --repo .

# Re-mirror anchor ADRs into architecture/decisions/:
java -cp tools/architecture-workspace/target/classes:$(cat /tmp/cp.txt) \
  com.huawei.ascend.tools.architecture.fragment.AdrMirrorCli --repo .

# Run the blocking-mode workspace gate (Linux/WSL per Rule G-7):
bash gate/check_architecture_workspace.sh
```

## How to add a new feature / function point / capability

| You want to … | Edit | Then |
|---|---|---|
| Add a new **capability** | `architecture/features/capabilities.dsl` — add an `element "X" "Capability" "..." "SAA Capability"` with required `saa.*` properties | re-emit fragments + validate; gate verifies the saa.id is unique |
| Add a new **function point** | `architecture/features/function-points.dsl` (the function point) + `architecture/features/verification.dsl` (the test edge) | same as above; ADR-link the function point via `saa.sourceAdr` |
| Add a new **module** | (1) add Maven module + populate `<module>/module-metadata.yaml`; (2) add a `container` declaration to `workspace.dsl`; (3) create `architecture/docs/L1/<module>.md` (or `<module>/` directory); (4) repoint `module-metadata.yaml#architecture_doc` | re-emit `generated/modules.dsl`; gate verifies the module appears |
| Add a new **L1 design view** for a module | If the module is on the single-narrative `<module>.md` shape, either extend that file OR graduate to a `<module>/` directory with per-view files | Update `architecture/docs/L1/README.md` to reflect the shape change |

## Lifecycle

- **W0** (2026-05-27, commit `9611096`): spike + ADR-0147 + ADR-0148 (4 PASS gates).
- **W1** (commit `3a8d4fe`): production tooling + profile + advisory gate + 141-rule impact matrix.
- **W2** (commit `ebf7533`): authored zone — 152 capabilities mounted + 15 function points + 7 tests + L1 narrative.
- **W3** (commit `d36303f`): generated zone — 7 fragment emitters + idempotency gate.
- **W4** (commit `8520aaa`): compatibility projection (`workspace -> architecture-workspace-graph.yaml`) + equivalence check.
- **W5** (commit `1026bbc`): authority transfer — Rule G-1.b amended, gate flips advisory → blocking, top-level docs updated.
- **W6** (commit `16cbe27`): YAML sunset roadmap (soak-blocked).
- **W7** (commit `825a8e2`): closure ADR-0149 + family registration + FULL GATE PASS.
- **W8** (current branch): docs consolidation under `architecture/docs/L1/`; ADR-0150 supersedes ADR-0143; `!docs` + `!adrs` directives wired; cross-doc reading-path + rhetorical-stance refresh.

Soak windows (real-world wall-clock; do not skip):
- W5 14-day soak: 2026-05-27 → 2026-06-10.
- W6 sub-wave soaks: 60 days (W6.a..W6.d each 15 days).
- W7 retirement candidates: eligible ~2026-07-25.

W8 lands DURING the W5 soak because it does not change authority direction — it only relocates files into the layout the direction already implies.
