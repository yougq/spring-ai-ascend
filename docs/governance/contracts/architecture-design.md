# Phase Contract — Architecture Design

## When you enter this phase

You are about to:

- Author an ADR (`docs/adr/NNNN-*.yaml`) or amend an existing one.
- Declare a new SPI (interface under `*/spi/*` + catalog row).
- Draft a module specification or change a module's `module-metadata.yaml`.
- Propose a topology change (planes, channels, dependency direction).
- Write or revise a design-review document under `docs/logs/reviews/`.
- Modify `ARCHITECTURE.md` (root) or any `agent-*/ARCHITECTURE.md` (L1).

Invoke `/design-mode` (Wave 3) at phase entry. Until Wave 3 ships, Read
this file directly before starting.

## Active rules — design phase

Markers: **P** = primary (this is the rule's home phase, where its full kernel
applies) · **X** = cross-reference (the rule is active here too but documented
under its primary phase). Rule body lives in the linked card; this table only
declares allocation.

## Forbidden patterns (this phase)

- Declaring a new SPI without a sibling `docs/dfx/<module>.yaml` covering the
  five DFX dimensions (Rule R-D).
- Modifying frozen L0/L1 artefacts (`ARCHITECTURE.md` sections with
  `freeze_id:`) without first writing a `docs/logs/reviews/` proposal
  (Rule G-1.a + ADR-0068).
- Introducing cross-module dependencies that violate the dependency
  allowlist (Rule R-C.1 + E1 enforcer).
- Authoring a rule kernel without specifying which phase contract owns it
  (Rule 126, lands in Wave 4 — for now declare `scope_phase:` in the card
  frontmatter manually).
- Drawing tree diagrams with deleted module names (`agent-platform`,
  `agent-runtime`) outside `formerly` / `pre-rc13` historical markers
  (Rule G-2.1).

## Exit criteria

- ADR landed under `docs/adr/NNNN-*.yaml` with `relates_to` / `extends`
  chains valid (Rule G-1.b graph idempotency).
- `principle-coverage.yaml` updated if the design touches a P-X
  operationalisation.
- Every new SPI declared in `module-metadata.yaml#spi_packages`,
  `docs/dfx/<module>.yaml`, and `docs/contracts/contract-catalog.md`
  (Rule R-D sub-clauses .b through .g).
- Gate G-1, G-2, G-8 clean (architecture graph regenerates byte-identical
  and authority surfaces agree).
- If the design changes an authority surface listed in any template's
  `context_loader` (e.g. `module-metadata.yaml`, `architecture-status.yaml`,
  `recurring-defect-families.yaml`, `pom.xml`), the design is NOT complete
  until the downstream rendered artefacts re-render byte-identical under
  Rule G-13. The implementation phase (`/impl-mode`) is responsible for
  the re-render; this phase MUST flag the dependency in the ADR's
  `consequences:` block so the implementer doesn't miss it.

## Composes with

- After design lands, the implementation phase starts → `/impl-mode`.
- When the design surfaces require release notes or ADR-to-release
  packaging → `/commit-mode`.
- When a reviewer challenges the design → `/review-mode` for the
  feedback cycle.
