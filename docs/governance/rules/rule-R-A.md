  **Platform code MUST NOT contain business-specific customizations. Business and example code MUST extend the platform via SPI + `@ConfigurationProperties` only — never by patching `*.impl.*` or `com.huawei.ascend.service.platform..`. The platform MUST ship a runnable quickstart (`docs/quickstart.md`) referenced from `README.md` so a developer reaches first-agent execution without platform-team intervention.**
---

## Motivation

Rule R-A is the in-repo enforceable expression of governing principle P-A (Business / Platform Decoupling + Developer Self-Service). Once any business-specific customization lands in platform code, every downstream tenant becomes a constraint on platform evolution; once any extension requires platform-team intervention, the platform stops being self-service. The two structural conditions — SPI-only extension and a runnable quickstart referenced from README — make decoupling and self-service simultaneously testable.

## Details

Enforced by E48 (`SpiPurityGeneralizedArchTest`) and Rule R-A.c (`quickstart_present`; CI quickstart smoke job per ADR-0064 + W4 activation).

## Cross-references

- ADR-0064 — origin decision record.
- P-A — governing principle Rule R-A operationalises.
- Architecture reference: §4 #60.
- Deferred sub-clause 29.c — quickstart smoke-run in CI (W1 trigger).
- Rule R-D sub-clause .a (SPI + DFX + TCK Co-Design) — co-enforced by E48 on the SPI purity side.

## Deferred sub-clauses

Rule R-A.c (see `docs/CLAUDE-deferred.md` for the deferred-runtime obligation(s) and re-introduction trigger(s)). Rule G-3 sub-clause .d (`kernel_deferred_clause_coherence`, rc9 / ADR-0083) asserts the bidirectional link between this active rule and each deferred sub-clause.
