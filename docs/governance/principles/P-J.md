  P-J — Storage-Engine Tenant Isolation.
  Tenant isolation lives at the storage engine, not the application code.
  Every tenant-scoped table MUST enable Row-Level Security policies;
  even a fully-compromised application tier cannot leak across tenants.
  Enforced by Rule R-J.a (V1/V2 grandfathered per
  `gate/rls-baseline-grandfathered.txt`; W2 retrofit per
  `retired-rules-audit.md` 40.b).

## Motivation

This principle exists because **application-layer tenant isolation is structurally insecure** — a single bypass (path traversal, ORM injection, broken WHERE filter, missing tenant_id propagation in a timer-driven resume) breaks every tenant at once. The historical record across multi-tenant SaaS shows this is the #1 cause of cross-tenant data leaks. Postgres Row-Level Security at the storage engine ensures that even if the application tier is fully compromised — even if every WHERE clause is stripped — the database itself refuses to return rows from a tenant other than the one in the connection's session context. V1/V2 migrations predating Rule R-J.a are grandfathered with a documented W2 retrofit obligation rather than silently exempted.
