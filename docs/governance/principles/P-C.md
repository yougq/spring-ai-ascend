  P-C — Code-as-Everything, Rapid Evolution, Independent Modules.
  Every architectural constraint is code.
  Modules evolve independently — each builds, tests, and upgrades on its own,
  with high cohesion and low coupling.
  Production-environment upgrades are lightweight
  (BoM + starter pattern + semver compatibility).
  Enforced by Rule R-C.a + Rule R-C.1.

## Motivation

This principle exists because **architecture text without enforcer code rots within one quarter** — reviewers cannot remember every prose constraint, LLM agents cannot traverse a flat prose pile, and drift accumulates silently between releases. The counter-discipline is two-sided: (1) **every architectural constraint is code** (Rule R-C.a — Code-as-Contract: every active normative constraint must reach an ArchUnit test, gate-script rule, integration test, schema constraint, or compile-time check), and (2) **modules evolve independently** (Rule R-C.1 — each module owns a `module-metadata.yaml`, builds in isolation via `mvn -pl <module> -am test`, and ships under BoM + starter semver). Together they make the platform upgradeable in production by changing one BoM version rather than re-vendoring source.

## Operationalising rules

- Rule R-C.a — Code-as-Contract ([`docs/governance/rules/rule-R-C.md`](../rules/rule-R-C.md))
- Rule R-C.1 — Independent Module Evolution ([`docs/governance/rules/rule-R-C.md`](../rules/rule-R-C.md))
