  P-H — Chronos Hydration.
  Long-horizon waits in business code MUST be declarative suspension
  (`SuspendSignal`), not physical thread sleep.
  The sleeping process self-destructs and re-hydrates on the bus wake-pulse.
  Enforced by Rule R-H.
scope_phase: design

## Motivation

This principle exists because **physical sleep holds a thread for the entire wait duration** — with 1000 sleeping agents across long-horizon orchestrations, the system is paralysed even though zero CPU work is happening. Chronos Hydration replaces the sleeping thread with a `SuspendSignal` checkpoint: the process record persists, the OS thread returns to the pool, and the bus wake-pulse re-hydrates the process when the wait condition resolves. This is the runtime counterpart to P-G's non-blocking I/O — together they guarantee no agent ever holds an OS thread while waiting on time, an external API, or a downstream callback.
