  P-G — Absolute Non-Blocking I/O.
  External I/O calls (model gateway, vector DB, sandbox dispatch) MUST use
  Reactive or Virtual Threads.
  The OS-level worker thread MUST be released during the I/O wait so other
  Agents can proceed.
  Enforced by Rule R-G.
  *(v2.0.0-rc3 honesty: the W2.x synchronous S2C bridge in
  `SyncOrchestrator.handleClientCallback` blocks on
  `.toCompletableFuture().join()` — this is a deliberately deferred exception
  tracked under Rule R-M sub-clause .d.c. Production deployments that need non-blocking S2C
  must wait for the W2 async orchestrator.)*

## Motivation

This principle exists because **a single blocking external call holds an OS thread for tens of seconds**; with ~10 stuck calls a 256-thread cluster paralyses, with ~100 it dies. Reactive (`WebClient` / `R2dbcEntityTemplate`) or Virtual-Thread-backed clients release the OS thread during the I/O wait, letting other Agents proceed on the freed thread. The doctrine is also paired with **operational honesty** — the v2.0.0-rc3 SyncOrchestrator bridge knowingly blocks during the S2C suspend/resume turn and is tracked under Rule R-M sub-clause .d.c rather than hidden as compliant, so that operators understand the deployment posture before they hit production load.
