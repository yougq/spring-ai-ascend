# agent-service — L1 4+1 Architecture (Index)

> Wave: rc55 W3-W5 + audit-2026-05-27 corrections; per-view content is active.
> Canonical 4+1 source per ADR-0143: the 5 per-view files + spi-appendix in this directory.
> Module-root L1 spec: [`agent-service/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../../agent-service/ARCHITECTURE.md) carries shipped-state grounding + cross-links here.
> Front-matter declares full 4+1 coverage per AUD-2026-05-27 PR77-P2-3 closure.

## 0. Why this directory exists

The rc53 4+1 rewrite landed the agent-service Logical / Process / Physical /
Development / Scenarios views as §§14-20 of an interaction record at
[`docs/logs/reviews/2026-05-26-agent-service-l1-4plus1-rewrite-wave-1.en.md`](../../logs/reviews/2026-05-26-agent-service-l1-4plus1-rewrite-wave-1.en.md).
That arrangement promoted a freeze-marked review log to "canonical L1 4+1 source", which
violated Rule G-1.a (architectural artefacts live under L0/L1/L2, not review logs) and
made the canonical source non-evolvable.

rc55 closes this defect (registered as `F-l1-canonical-source-in-interaction-log` in
[`recurring-defect-families.yaml`](../../governance/recurring-defect-families.yaml))
via [ADR-0143](../../adr/0143-review-log-demotion-l1-canonical-move.yaml):
the canonical 4+1 source moves to the 5 per-view files in this directory; the rc53
review file is demoted to historical authoring record. Per-view edit isolation is
preserved (changing the Logical View no longer requires editing the 1362-line review
file that also holds Process + Physical + Development).

## 1. View files (Wave landing schedule)

| File | View | Wave | Frontmatter |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`scenarios.md`](scenarios.md) | Scenarios | rc55 W3 | `level: L1, view: scenarios` |
| [`logical.md`](logical.md) | Logical | rc55 W3 | `level: L1, view: logical` |
| [`process.md`](process.md) | Process | rc55 W4 | `level: L1, view: process` |
| [`physical.md`](physical.md) | Physical | rc55 W4 | `level: L1, view: physical` |
| [`development.md`](development.md) | Development | rc55 W5 | `level: L1, view: development` |
| [`spi-appendix.md`](spi-appendix.md) | Development (appendix) | rc55 W5 | `level: L1, view: development` |

Each file declares per-view frontmatter per Rule G-1.a; no file declares
`covers_views:` plural — that field is reserved for this index file only.

## 2. rc55 design ratifications

The rc55 audit produced 6 ADRs that constrain how the per-view files MUST be
authored:

| ADR | Subject | Affects |
|---|---|---|
| [ADR-0140](../../adr/0140-engine-adapter-layer-split.yaml) | Engine Adapter Layer split 5a/5b; RuntimeMiddleware exclusively in Layer 4 | logical.md, development.md |
| [ADR-0141](../../adr/0141-internal-event-queue-design-only.yaml) | Internal Event Queue is design_only sub-section (no peer-layer code home yet) | logical.md, development.md, physical.md |
| [ADR-0142](../../adr/0142-run-aggregate-single-owner.yaml) | Run aggregate owned exclusively by Layer 2; Layer 4 uses RunRepository typed reference | logical.md, process.md |
| [ADR-0143](../../adr/0143-review-log-demotion-l1-canonical-move.yaml) | This directory IS the canonical 4+1 source | all per-view files |
| [ADR-0144](../../adr/0144-layer-vs-package-matrix.yaml) | Layer↔Package matrix unifies ADR-0100 + ADR-0138 decompositions | development.md, logical.md |
| [ADR-0145](../../adr/0145-run-event-sealed-hierarchy.yaml) | Sealed RunEvent hierarchy specification (Java sealed type lands in follow-up impl-mode wave) | logical.md, process.md, development.md |
