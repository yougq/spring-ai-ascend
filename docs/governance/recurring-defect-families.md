# Recurring Defect Families — Human View

> **What this is.** A categorised summary of defect ROOT-CAUSE CLASSES that
> have recurred across multiple rc waves (rc4 → rc16). The canonical
> machine-readable form is [`recurring-defect-families.yaml`](recurring-defect-families.yaml);
> this `.md` is a rendered view for human readers and reviewers.
>
> **What this is NOT.** A release log. Per-wave narratives stay in
> `docs/logs/releases/`. Per-review findings stay in `docs/logs/reviews/`.
> This document is one level above both — it answers "what classes of
> defect have we seen, and is each one fully cleaned?"
>
> **When this is updated.** Every architecture refresh — new ADR, change
> in `architecture-status.yaml#baseline_metrics`, new release note in
> `docs/logs/releases/`, change in the `#### Rule X` heading set in
> `CLAUDE.md`. Gate Rule 111 (Rule G-9) FAILS if the refresh-signal
> commit predates this file's mtime by more than 24h.
>
> **Why this matters.** Reviewer scope is often narrower than defect
> scope (rc10 meta-lesson). Without a derived view of recurring families,
> the same root cause re-fires for 4-8 rc waves before someone realises
> it's a class, not a one-off. Rule 110 META gates the prevention-rule
> taxonomy; this document is the human-readable mirror.

## §1 — Family Summary (8 families as of rc17)

| # | Family ID | Title | RC Occurrences | Cleanup |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| 1 | F-numeric-drift | Numeric Drift Across Authority Surfaces | 9 | ⚠️ partial |
| 2 | F-deleted-module-name-leakage | Deleted-Module-Name Leakage After Refactor | 6 | ✅ structurally addressed (rc17) |
| 3 | F-authority-surface-path-drift | Authority-Surface Path Drift After Refactor | 8 | ⚠️ partial |
| 4 | F-kernel-vs-implementation-drift | Prevention Rule Kernel vs Implementation Drift | 4 | ⚠️ partial |
| 5 | F-cross-authority-agreement | Cross-Authority Surface Disagreement | 3 | ✅ structurally addressed (rc14-16) |
| 6 | F-deferred-clause-orphan | CLAUDE-deferred.md Orphan | 3 | ⚠️ partial |
| 7 | F-shadow-corpus-prose-staleness | Shadow Corpus Prose Staleness (gate/rules/) | 6 | ⚠️ partial |
| 8 | F-terminal-verb-overclaim | Active Kernel Terminal Verb vs Deferred Decision | 3 | ✅ closed (rc16) |

**Cleanup status legend.**
- ✅ **closed** — no recurrence expected; prevention rule covers all known surfaces.
- ✅ **structurally addressed** — META rule in place that detects future variants; per-instance defects may still appear in newly-introduced surfaces but are now gateable.
- ⚠️ **partial** — prevention rules exist but cover known surfaces only; new surfaces remain at risk.
- ❌ **incomplete** — defects recur faster than prevention rules can be widened (no current family at this status as of rc17).

## §2 — Per-Family Detail

### F-numeric-drift — Numeric Drift Across Authority Surfaces

**Pattern.** Numeric claims (rule counts, gate counts, enforcer counts,
graph nodes/edges, self-tests) are estimated when a release note is
written and then never re-aligned. The first estimate becomes a de-facto
baseline; subsequent drift compounds until a reviewer catches it.

**Surfaces.**
- `docs/governance/architecture-status.yaml#baseline_metrics`
- `README.md` and `gate/README.md`
- Latest `docs/logs/releases/*.md`
- `CLAUDE.md` kernel numeric claims
- `docs/governance/architecture-graph.yaml` header

**Prevention chronology.** Rule 82 (rc6 single source) → Rule 91 (rc9
manifest match) → Rule 97 (rc10 release-note truth) → Rule 101 (rc12
namespace parity) → Rule G-8.a (rc14 graph baseline parity).

**Open residual.** rc16 P2-1 surfaced lingering drift. A structured
re-baseline ritual at release time has not yet been codified.

---

### F-deleted-module-name-leakage — Deleted-Module-Name Leakage After Refactor

**Pattern.** Major structural refactors (Phase C / ADR-0078, ADR-0079,
ADR-0088) delete modules whose names persist in 7–10 corpus surfaces.
Each subsequent rc cycle finds another partition the previous prevention
rule did not scan, because reviewer scope was narrower than defect scope.

**Surfaces.**
- `agent-*/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/contracts/*.yaml`
- `ops/**/*.{yaml,yml,tpl,md}`
- `docs/quickstart.md`
- `.github/workflows/*.yml`
- `Dockerfile`
- `docs/**/*.puml`
- `**/module-metadata.yaml`
- `docs/telemetry/policy.md`
- `spring-ai-ascend-dependencies/module-metadata.yaml`

**Prevention chronology.** Rule 93 (rc9) → Rule 94 (rc9) → Rule 98 (rc10
broad-corpus widening) → Rule 103 (rc12 deploy entrypoints) → Rule 109
(rc16 namespace ratchet) → Rule G-2.1 (rc17 consolidation).

**Open residual.** Future refactors will still leak into new surfaces.
Rule 110 META + Rule G-9 freshness gate are the backstops; surface
discovery moves from reactive (reviewer finds it) to proactive
(prevention rule frontmatter enumerates it).

---

### F-authority-surface-path-drift — Authority-Surface Path Drift After Refactor

**Pattern.** Code refactors land first; authority surfaces lag 2–6 waves.
Adjacent to F-deleted-module-name-leakage but distinct: this family
covers path truth (correct module, wrong path) while the other covers
name truth (deleted module mentioned at all).

**Surfaces.**
- `docs/contracts/contract-catalog.md`
- `docs/contracts/*.v1.yaml`
- `agent-*/ARCHITECTURE.md` path claims
- `module-metadata.yaml#spi_packages`

**Prevention chronology.** Rule 84 (rc6) → Rule 94 (rc9) → Rule 98 (rc10)
→ Rule 103 (rc12) → Rule G-8.b/.d (rc14 parity) → Rule G-8.e (rc15
structural-carrier parity).

**Open residual.** Crosses with F-deleted-module-name-leakage. Reviewer-
narrow scope causes families to share residual surface.

---

### F-kernel-vs-implementation-drift — Prevention Rule Kernel vs Implementation Drift

**Pattern.** A prevention rule's kernel paragraph documents intent X
while its gate-script implementation checks only Y (Y ⊂ X). Worst class
of Code-as-Contract drift: the rule whose JOB is preventing drift itself
drifts.

**Surfaces.**
- `gate/check_architecture_sync.sh`
- `docs/governance/rules/*.md` kernel scalars
- `CLAUDE.md` kernel paragraphs

**Prevention chronology.** Rule 82 (rc6) → Rule 99 (rc11) → Rule 100
(rc11) → Rule 106 (rc14) → Rule 107 (rc16).

**Open residual.** Every newly-added rule carries the same risk. Rule
G-9 (rc17) requires `scope_surfaces:` frontmatter, making
kernel-vs-impl drift gateable at addition time, not only at the next
reviewer pass.

---

### F-cross-authority-agreement — Cross-Authority Surface Disagreement

**Pattern.** 117+ single-surface prevention rules can all pass while the
surfaces themselves contradict each other. Per-surface self-consistency
is necessary but not sufficient.

**Surfaces.**
- `architecture-status.yaml` ↔ `architecture-graph.yaml`
- `CLAUDE.md` kernel ↔ `rule-*.md` cards
- `module-metadata.yaml` ↔ `contract-catalog.md`
- `pom.xml` modules ↔ `architecture-status.yaml#repository_counts`

**Prevention chronology.** Rule 106 (rc14) → Rule G-8 (rc14 mega-rule,
4 sub-checks) → Rule G-8.e (rc15) → Rule 107 (rc16 clause parity) →
Rule 108 (rc16 java anchor truth) → Rule 109 (rc16 namespaced ref).

**Open residual.** Every new rule MUST enumerate its authority surfaces.
Drift will reappear only if a rule introduces a new surface without
declaring it (Rule 110 META + Rule G-9 freshness gate).

---

### F-deferred-clause-orphan — CLAUDE-deferred.md Orphan

**Pattern.** Three-way sync (kernel ↔ card ↔ deferred-doc) is
author-driven; a kernel change can leave a deferred sub-clause
unacknowledged, or vice versa.

**Surfaces.**
- `CLAUDE.md` kernel
- `docs/governance/rules/*.md` cards
- `docs/CLAUDE-deferred.md`

**Prevention chronology.** Rule 99 (rc11 kernel-deferred coherence) →
Rule 107 (rc16 clause-parity ratchet).

**Open residual.** Sub-clauses can still be cited in one surface but not
the other two. Future ratchet would gate three-way set equality.

---

### F-shadow-corpus-prose-staleness — Shadow Corpus Prose Staleness (gate/rules/)

**Pattern.** `gate/rules/*.sh` is described as "IDE-only generated" but
prose comment blocks (slug names, ADR refs) drift as
`gate/check_architecture_sync.sh` evolves. Generated artefacts are not
actually regenerated on every change.

**Surfaces.**
- `gate/rules/*.sh`
- `gate/check_architecture_sync.sh` comment headers

**Prevention chronology.** Rule 92 (rc9) → Rule 97 (rc10) → Rule 109
(rc16).

**Open residual.** Genuine fix is to make `gate/rules/*` truly
auto-generated, or delete the directory. Low-severity but recurring.

---

### F-terminal-verb-overclaim — Active Kernel Terminal Verb vs Deferred Decision

**Pattern.** Active rule kernels use end-state verbs ("are SUSPENDED",
"transitions to FAILED", "consumes the * capacity") for behaviour whose
Run-state transition is W2-deferred. The shipped Java surface only
returns a decision envelope.

**Surfaces.**
- `CLAUDE.md` kernel paragraphs
- `docs/governance/rules/*.md` card kernels
- `agent-*/ARCHITECTURE.md` body text

**Prevention chronology.** Rule 99 (rc11) → Rule 108 (rc16).

**Open residual.** None. Rule 108 widens scope to all active corpus
prose; rc16 closure was the last known instance.

---

## §3 — META-Lessons Codified Into Rules

The recurring-family pattern itself is a defect class. The following
meta-lessons were progressively codified across rc waves; rc17 adds Rule
G-9 + this document as the structural backstop.

| Wave | Meta-Lesson | Codification |
|---|---|---|
| rc8 | "Category-wide sweep finds 14× more defects than reviewer's one cited surface" (rc8 found 14 hidden behind 8 cited findings) | rc8 release-note methodology paragraph; rc10 adopts as standing discipline |
| rc10 | "Reviewer scope can be narrower than defect scope" — Rule 94 scoped to 3 surfaces; family I-ε spans 7 | rc10 release-note explicit paragraph (P0-2); rc11 doubles down (J-β found 30+); **rc16 Rule 110 META** finally gates the discipline |
| rc11 | "Categorize → Sweep → Batch-fix → Prevention" is now a hard sequencing rule | rc11 release-note Methodology section; followed by every wave rc12 onward |
| rc12 | "Authority-surface parity is a separate gate from kernel-card coherence" | Rule 101 (rc12); Rule G-8 (rc14 consolidates the variants) |
| rc12 | "Lex sort on dated filenames is a class bug, not one-off" — encode 'latest' as typed sortable field | `gate/lib/latest_release.sh::latest_release_path` (rc12); Rule 102 gates the pattern |
| rc14 | "Cross-authority parity is its own defect family" — 117 single-surface rules can all pass while surfaces contradict each other (L-δ META) | Rule G-8 (rc14 mega-rule, 4 sub-checks); widened rc15 Rule G-8.e + Rule G-3.e |
| rc15 | "Sub-clause widening > sibling rule for cross-surface families" | Rule G-8 establishes the pattern (rc15); ADR-0091 records the decision |
| rc16 | "Recurrence pattern is itself gateable" | Rule 110 META — every prevention rule MUST declare `scope_surfaces:` + ≥2 self-test fixtures across distinct surfaces |
| **rc17** | **"Recurring families deserve a first-class derived view"** — reviewer should be able to ask "has this class been seen before?" without re-reading 16 release notes | **This document + `recurring-defect-families.yaml` + Rule G-9 + Gate Rule 111 freshness check** |
