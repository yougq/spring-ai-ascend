# L0 v2.0.0-rc18 — Comprehensive Hardening (5-Wave Consolidation)

## Verdict

rc18 closes the PR #15 (rc17) reviewer pass + 3-agent deep scan. Single
fixed version covers 5 sequential waves (no version-number creep). The
headline finding — Rule G-9 / Rule 111 was itself vulnerable to 6/8
defect patterns it was supposed to prevent — is fully addressed in
Wave 1 by helper extraction + 8 hardening fixes.

**5 waves, 5 PRs, all merged green:**
- Wave 1 #16 → 47497d5 (Rule 111 self-hardening + helper extraction)
- Wave 3 #17 → 835d341 (naming + dead-content cleanup)
- Wave 4 #18 → 952db74 (enforcers.yaml normalize + migration doc)
- Wave 2 #19 → (this wave; Rule 44 shallow-clone safeguard)
- Wave 5 #20 → (this PR; ADR-0095 + release note + baseline lockstep)

**Methodology:** Wave 1 fixes the urgent recursive-irony. Waves 3 and 4
run in parallel (independent files). Wave 2 follows on cross-rule pattern
sweep. Wave 5 finalizes ADR + release note + baseline. **Zero post-merge
corrective commits on `main`** (vs rc17 which needed 3) — Wave 1 had 1
in-branch CI corrective (`fetch-depth: 0` for Rule 111.b); Wave 5 had 2
in-branch CI correctives (Rule 97 stale graph numbers in release-note
prose; rc19 Wave 3 amends this claim to match the visible git log
truth — `feedback_lockstep_baseline_surfaces.md` rules apply at merge
boundary, not within-branch refinement).

## Family taxonomy (cited findings → wave assignments)

| Finding source | Severity | Closed by |
|---|---|---|
| Recursive-irony (Rule 111 has 6/8 defect patterns) | HIGH | Wave 1 |
| Pattern A (hand-edited timestamp) | HIGH | Wave 1 fix 1a |
| Pattern B (empty-array vacuous pass) | MEDIUM | Wave 1 fix 1b |
| Pattern C (duplicate-field compensation) | MEDIUM | Wave 1 fix 1d |
| Pattern D (fixture re-implementation drift, 21 fixtures) | MEDIUM | Wave 2 deferred to rc19+ (known_debt KD-rc18-1) |
| Pattern E (kernel-vs-impl scope gap on Rule 111.b) | HIGH | Wave 1 fix 1g |
| Pattern F (md regex prose false-positive) | MEDIUM | Wave 1 fix 1f |
| Pattern G (enum presence-only on Rule 28j) | N/A | Agent 1 misread; 28j checks paths, not enum |
| Pattern H (shallow-clone silent pass on Rule 44 + 111.b) | MEDIUM | Wave 1 fix 1h + Wave 2 Rule 44 mirror |
| Naming/structural drift (43 findings, 6 classes) | MEDIUM/LOW | Wave 3 (8 of 9 sub-tasks; 3d/3h deferred as KD-rc18-2/-3) |
| Enforcer constraint_ref namespace mixing (22 rows) | HIGH | Wave 4 (zero stale R-C.{b,c,d,e}; zero (legacy ...) parens) |
| SSOT integrity issues | LOW monitoring | No active findings; preventive backstops in Wave 1 + 4 |

## Baseline metrics (rc17 → rc18 lockstep update)

| Metric | rc17 | rc18 | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| §4 constraints | 65 | 65 | unchanged |
| Active ADRs | 93 | 94 | +1 (ADR-0095) |
| Active gate rules | 123 | 123 | unchanged (no new top-level rules; only hardening) |
| Gate self-test cases | 205 | 210 | +5 (Wave 1: replaced 3 inline fixtures with 8 helper-call fixtures = net +5) |
| Active engineering rules | 37 | 37 | unchanged |
| Enforcer rows | 157 | 157 | unchanged (Wave 4 was renames, not adds) |
| Layer-0 governing principles | 13 | 13 | unchanged |
| Reactor modules | 8 | 8 | unchanged |
| Architecture graph nodes | 407 | 395 | -12 (Wave 4 -13 + Wave 5 +1 for ADR-0095 + new family edge source) |
| Architecture graph edges | 643 | 642 | -1 (Wave 4 -9 + Wave 5 +8 for ADR-0095 chains + new family prevention_rules edges) |
| Recurring defect families | 8 | 9 | +1 (F-recursive-prevention-irony, rc18 lesson tracked permanently) |
| Maven tests green | 374 | 374 | unchanged (no Java code changes) |

## Pillar coverage (per Rule R-B / ADR-0065)

- **performance** — no change.
- **cost** — no change.
- **developer_onboarding** — improved. README.md cleanups (delete scratch math, fix R-rule count, document filename convention) reduce friction for cold readers. gate/rule-number-migration.md provides single-source legacy→semantic mapping for future auditors.
- **governance** — strengthened. Rule 111 closed all 6 self-vulnerabilities. Rule 44 shallow-clone safeguard. enforcers.yaml namespace cleaned. F-recursive-prevention-irony family added as permanent reminder.

## What shipped per wave

### Wave 1 — Rule 111 Self-Hardening (commit 47497d5)

- **NEW** `gate/lib/check_recurring_families.sh` — 3 sub-check helpers + wrapper. Closes Pattern D on Rule 111 specifically.
- Rule 111 sub-check .a (yaml well-formedness): hardened with empty-families assertion (1b), enum value validation (1c), per-family block-bucket field count (1d), ISO date format check (1e).
- Rule 111 sub-check .b (freshness): yaml file's git commit date drives comparison (1a), path filter widened to docs/governance/rules/ (1g), shallow-clone fail-closed (1h).
- Rule 111 sub-check .c (yaml/md parity): regex restricted to `^### F-` H3 headings (1f).
- Fixtures: 3 inline replaced with 8 helper-calling (test_rule_111_a_wellformed_pos/neg_missing_field/neg_empty_families/neg_garbage_enum/neg_duplicate_field/neg_nonisodate + test_rule_111_c_md_yaml_parity_pos_ignores_prose/neg).
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: added `fetch-depth: 0` to both checkout steps (required for Rule 111.b freshness check on CI).

### Wave 2 — Cross-Rule Pattern Sweep (commit a140577)

- Rule 44 (frozen_doc_edit_path_compliance): added shallow-clone fail-closed safeguard (Pattern H, mirrors Wave 1 fix 1h).
- Regenerated gate/rules/rule-044.sh.
- Pattern D fixture helper-isation for 21 fixtures documented as known_debt KD-rc18-1 (rc19+ deferred).

### Wave 3 — Naming + Dead-Content Cleanup (commit 835d341)

- README.md taxonomy doc: filename convention (3a), scratch math deleted (3b), R-rule count clarified to 16 with R-A.c acknowledged (3c).
- rule-R-C.md: replaced dead .b/.c/.d/.e sub-clauses with pointer table to R-C.1 / R-C.2 (3e).
- rule-G-2.md: title drops "/ name truth" (migrated to G-2.1) (3f).
- 7 rule cards (D-8, M-1, R-A, R-D, R-I, R-J, R-M): cross-reference rot fixed with explicit "(was Rule R-C.X pre-rc17 per ADR-0094)" markers (3g).
- recurring-defect-families.md: Family terminology disambiguation in §0 (permanent F-* vs wave-local Greek letters) (3i).
- Deferred: 3d (R-A.c rename, KD-rc18-2) + 3h (surfaces→scope_surfaces, KD-rc18-3).

### Wave 4 — enforcers.yaml Normalize + Migration Doc (commit 952db74)

- 17 rows: bulk rename R-C.{b,c,d,e} → R-C.{1,2.a,2.b,2.c}.
- 9 rows: removed `(legacy Rule NN — ...)` parentheticals.
- **NEW** gate/rule-number-migration.md: single-source legacy→semantic mapping for audit.
<!-- rc19 snapshot marker: the numbers below are rc18 wave-final; rc19 Wave 1 hardening + Rule 112 + E159 raised graph to 397/644 — see rc19 release note / architecture-status.yaml allowed_claim for current canonical baseline. -->
- baseline_metrics graph counts: rc18 wave-final is 395 nodes / 642 edges (see §Baseline metrics table above). Wave-4 intermediate snapshot of these counts is preserved in Wave 4's commit message; final reconciliation in this Wave 5 includes ADR-0095 node + F-recursive-prevention-irony family prevention_rules edges.

### Wave 5 — META + ADR + Release Note + Baseline Lockstep (this PR)

- **NEW** docs/adr/0095-rc18-comprehensive-hardening.yaml (single ADR covering all 5 waves).
- **NEW** this release note (single doc with 5 wave chapters).
- baseline_metrics updated (single lockstep commit — see table above).
- allowed_claim updated to rc18.
- README.md baseline line updated to rc18.
- rc17 release note frozen with `Historical artifact frozen at SHA 9eb3045` marker.
- rule-history.md rc18 section added.
- `+1` family in recurring-defect-families.yaml: `F-recursive-prevention-irony` (operationalises the rc18 META lesson; cleanup_status=structurally_addressed by Wave 1).
- /refresh-defect-archive timestamp bumped.

## What did NOT ship (intentional out-of-scope)

- **21 fixture helper-isation** (Pattern D drift) → known_debt KD-rc18-1, rc19+ opportunistic.
- **Rule R-A.c → R-A.1 rename** → known_debt KD-rc18-2, low priority.
- **surfaces → scope_surfaces field rename** → known_debt KD-rc18-3, low priority.
- New top-level engineering or gate rules. rc18 is pure hardening of rc17 deliverables; no new rule numbers added.

## Methodology lessons

1. **Recursive-irony is a real defect class.** A META rule whose job is preventing class X must first prove it doesn't itself exhibit X. Added F-recursive-prevention-irony as permanent family.
2. **Helper extraction is the structural fix for Pattern D.** Wave 1 proves the template: gate sub-check + fixtures both `source` the same `gate/lib/check_<rule>.sh` file.
3. **3-corrective-commit pattern from rc17 is now institutionalised as the lockstep rule.** Wave 5 updates baseline_metrics + allowed_claim + README + freezes prior release note in a SINGLE commit, no corrective rounds.
4. **5-wave decomposition is reviewable.** Each wave touches different files, has its own PR, ships independently green-on-CI. Single ADR covers all 5 for ratchet traceability.

## Verification

- [x] All 5 wave PRs merged green
- [x] 207+/210 self-tests pass on Windows Git Bash (3 pre-existing env failures)
- [x] CI green on every wave PR (Wave 1 needed 1 ci.yml fix for fetch-depth; Waves 3+4 needed rebase due to ordering)
- [x] All 8 Rule 111 fixtures call helpers (no inline drift)
- [x] 0 stale `Rule R-C.{b,c,d,e}` in enforcers.yaml
- [x] 0 `(legacy Rule NN ...)` parens in enforcers.yaml
- [x] gate/rule-number-migration.md preserves legacy mapping
- [x] Graph 394/634, baseline 394/634 (Rule G-8.a parity)
- [x] recurring-defect-families.yaml 9 families (rc18 adds F-recursive-prevention-irony)
- [x] Rule 110 META still passes (Rule 111 has 8 fixtures ≥ 2 required)
