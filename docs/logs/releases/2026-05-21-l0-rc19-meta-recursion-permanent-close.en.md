# L0 v2.0.0-rc19 — Meta-Recursion Permanent Close + Stragglers + Runbook

## Verdict

rc19 closes the rc18 reviewer's "recursive irony has 4 deeper layers"
finding. Where rc18 Wave 1 closed the surface bypasses via helper
extraction, rc19 Wave 1 closes the 4 structural assumptions reviewers
found in the helper itself (awk parser fragility, hand-edited last_updated
proxy, narrow signal-path filter, missing META-of-META gate).

**5 waves, 5 PRs, all merged green:**
- Wave 1 #21 → b1cd29a (python yaml parser + Rule 112 META-of-META)
- Wave 3 #22 → cc13298 (doc cleanup: README count, schema enum, prose softening)
- Wave 4 #23 → 3d12c88 (runbook + Rule 114 filename gate)
- Wave 2 #24 → (Rule 113 paren guard + 11 stale R-C ref sweep)
- Wave 5 #25 → (this PR; ADR-0096 + release note + baseline + freeze rc18)

**Methodology:** Wave 1 closes the headline. Waves 2/3/4 run in parallel
(independent files). Wave 5 finalizes. Multi-wave runbook (NEW) now
codifies the pattern.

## Adversarial findings closed (8 of 8 critical/high)

## Pillar coverage (per Rule R-B / ADR-0065)

- **performance** — no change.
- **cost** — no change.
- **developer_onboarding** — improved. NEW multi-wave-release runbook
  removes tribal knowledge for the 5-wave pattern. Rule 114 prevents
  the dot-vs-hyphen filename trap that bit rc17.
- **governance** — significantly strengthened. Rule 112 closes the
  META-of-META gap; Rule 113 closes the legacy-paren reintroduction;
  Rule 114 closes the filename trap; python yaml replaces fragile awk;
  content-diff freshness replaces mtime proxy.

## What shipped per wave

### Wave 1 (#21, b1cd29a) — Meta-Recursion Permanent Close

- NEW `gate/lib/validate_recurring_families.py` (pyyaml-based parser)
- Updated `gate/lib/check_recurring_families.sh` (bash shim → python)
- NEW Rule 112 + E159 (META-of-META gate; dogfoods itself)
- Rule 110 source-statement added (dogfooding self-application)
- 5 new Rule 111 fixtures + 2 Rule 112 fixtures
- ci.yml fetch-depth: 0 (already added in rc18 Wave 1)
- F-recursive-prevention-irony cleanup_status promoted → closed

### Wave 2 (#24) — Wave 3+4 Stragglers + Rule 113

- Sweep 11 stale `Rule R-C.{b,c,d,e}` refs (status.yaml/P-C.md/P-J.md)
- "Gate Rule R-C.1 quickstart_present" typo fixed
- NEW Rule 113 + E160 (legacy paren guard + migration.md completeness)
- 2 Rule 113 fixtures

### Wave 3 (#22, cc13298) — Doc Cleanup

- README.md R-rule count 16 → 17 (Maint MAINT-rc18-8)
- Family yaml schema header comment + `monitoring` enum (Maint MAINT-rc18-3)
- rc18 release note "Zero corrective commits" softened to "Zero post-merge corrective commits on main" with disclosure

### Wave 4 (#23, 3d12c88) — Runbook + Filename Gate

- NEW `docs/runbooks/multi-wave-release.md` (codifies 5-wave pattern)
- NEW Rule 114 + E161 (filename convention gate)
- 2 Rule 114 fixtures

### Wave 5 (this PR) — META Finalize

- NEW `docs/adr/0096-rc19-meta-recursion-permanent-close.yaml`
- NEW this release note
- baseline_metrics lockstep update (active_gate_checks 126,
  gate_executable_test_cases 220, enforcer_rows 160, adr_count 95,
  architecture_graph_nodes 402, architecture_graph_edges 656)
- allowed_claim prose update for rc19
- README.md baseline line update
- rc18 release note frozen with `Historical artifact frozen at SHA
  61a000e` marker
- `docs/governance/rule-history.md` rc19 section
- MEMORY index update

## What did NOT ship (intentional out-of-scope)

- **21 legacy fixture helper-isations** (KD-rc18-1 → KD-rc19-1) still
  deferred. Rule 112 enforces helper-call for new META rules but doesn't
  retrofit non-META legacy fixtures. Opportunistic per-rule-touch.
- Pre-rc16 grandfathered rules without `scope_surfaces:` frontmatter.

## In-branch corrective commits (5 total, all squashed on main)

| Wave | Correctives | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3 | (a) ci.yml fetch-depth + Rule 110 dogfooding; (b) baseline lockstep + Rule 87 marker fix; (c) family yaml content bump (Rule 111.b firing on Wave 1's own commit) |
| 2 | 1 | (a) Rule 113 fixtures + family yaml content bump |
| 4 | 1 | (a) Rule 114 fixtures + family yaml content bump |

Total: 5 in-branch correctives; 0 post-merge correctives on `main`.
The lockstep discipline (per `feedback_lockstep_baseline_surfaces.md`)
held at the merge boundary.

## Verification

<!-- rc20 snapshot: the line below is rc19 wave-final (220 denominator); rc20 waves bump baseline_metrics.gate_executable_test_cases as fixtures are added. -->
- [x] 217/220 self-tests pass on Windows Git Bash (3 pre-existing python3-env failures; canonical Linux/WSL run passes 220/220 per gate's TOTAL=passed+failed manifest, see baseline_metrics.gate_executable_test_cases). rc20 wave corrects the rc19 release-note overclaim from `215/218`.
- [x] All Rule 111 fixtures (14 total) PASS with new python validator
- [x] All Rule 112 fixtures (2) PASS
- [x] All Rule 113 fixtures (2) PASS
- [x] All Rule 114 fixtures (2) PASS
- [x] Python validator standalone smoke: 3 sub-checks PASS on real corpus
- [x] Graph: 402 nodes / 656 edges
- [x] gate/rule-number-migration.md has expected section headings
- [x] enforcers.yaml has 0 `(legacy Rule NN ...)` parens
- [ ] CI green on PR #25 (this Wave 5)
