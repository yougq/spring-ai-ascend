# rc8 Post-Corrective Architecture Review — Response

## Executive verdict

**Accept all 7 findings.** None of them are runtime architecture defects — they're contract-truth, authority-truth, kernel-truth, and gate-evidence defects of exactly the shape that have driven each rc4→rc8 wave. Rejecting any would re-open the bidirectional drift the rc5–rc8 prevention waves were built to close.

Authority: ADR-0083 (rc9 corpus-truth + CI-acceptance).

## Family taxonomy

Mirrors the rc5–rc8 G-α/G-β/F-α/F-β pattern:

| Family | Findings | Prevention rule |
|---|---|---|
| **H-α** Manifest-truth / count-derivation drift | P0-1, P1-4 | Rule 91 (`baseline_metric_matches_executable_manifest`) |
| **H-β** Orphan-authority / deleted-name surfaces | P0-2, P0-3, P1-3 | Rules 92, 93, 94 |
| **H-γ** SPI catalog completeness | P1-2 | Rule 95 (`spi_catalog_exhaustiveness`) |
| **H-δ** Active/deferred kernel-truth boundary | P1-1 | Rule 96 (`kernel_deferred_clause_coherence`) |
| **H-ε** Shadow-corpus freshness | P2-1 | Rule 92 (shares with H-β) |

## Per-finding response

### P0-1 — Baseline count taxonomy (74 vs 102 → 108)

**Accepted.** The published `active_gate_checks: 74` was the historical "rule families" count (top-level rule numbers in the canonical script comment block, excluding sub-rules 28a-28k and 36b/41b). The parallel summary trailer always reported the literal section count (102 pre-rc9, 108 with new Rules 91-96). The 28-section gap persisted across 8 release notes because nothing checked manifest-vs-ledger agreement.

**Action.**
- ADR-0083 picks the executable-section count as the canonical meaning of `active_gate_checks`. Updated `docs/governance/architecture-status.yaml#baseline_metrics.active_gate_checks` to 108 (102 + 6 rc9 rules); the historical family count is preserved in `active_engineering_rules_post_rcN`.
- Updated `README.md`, `gate/README.md`, and `allowed_claim:` prose to say "108 active gate rules".
- Updated the top-of-file comment in `gate/check_architecture_sync.sh` (reviewer's recommendation #4) — the "63 top-level active rules" wave history is now replaced with a structured wave-by-wave history through rc9.
- Introduced **Rule 91 (`baseline_metric_matches_executable_manifest`)** to enforce the ledger-vs-canonical-manifest axis at gate time. Closes finding.

### P0-2 — `docs/STATE.md` archived

**Accepted.**

**Action.**
- Moved `docs/STATE.md` → `docs/archive/2026-05-19-STATE-md-archived/STATE.md` with a non-authoritative front-matter banner ("Historical artifact frozen at SHA d4ee319, pre-rc9").
- Rewrote `ARCHITECTURE.md:861` to point at `docs/governance/architecture-status.yaml` (with a historical pointer-marker to the archive path).
- Rule 94 (introduced for P1-3 closure) widens the path-truth discipline so future stale ledgers can't escape detection in the active corpus.

### P0-3 — Orphan `docs/dfx/agent-platform.yaml` deleted

**Accepted.**

**Action.**
- `git rm docs/dfx/agent-platform.yaml`.
- Introduced **Rule 93 (`dfx_stem_matches_module`)**: every `docs/dfx/*.yaml` stem (excluding `docs/archive/`) must match a `<module>` entry in root `pom.xml`. ADR-0082 mandated removal; rc9 institutionalises the gate. Closes finding.

### P1-1 — Rule 42 + Rule 46 active kernels narrowed

**Accepted.**

**Action.**
- **Rule 42 kernel** (CLAUDE.md + `docs/governance/rules/rule-42.md`): removed "The runtime `SandboxExecutor` MUST refuse a logical permission grant whose scope exceeds the declared physical limits." Replaced with "Runtime refusal of over-wide logical grants by `SandboxExecutor` is deferred to Rule 42.b (W2) per `docs/CLAUDE-deferred.md`."
- **Rule 46 kernel**: replaced "Callbacks consume the `s2c.client.callback` skill capacity declared in `docs/governance/skill-capacity.yaml`." with "An `s2c.client.callback` skill capacity row MUST be declared in `docs/governance/skill-capacity.yaml`; runtime admission against that row (`ResilienceContract.resolve(tenant, "s2c.client.callback")`) is deferred to Rule 46.b (W2)."
- **Rule 46 card** sub-clause list corrected: `46.b` is now explicitly labeled as "`ResilienceContract s2c.client.callback` runtime admission wiring" (matching `docs/CLAUDE-deferred.md` 46.b); `46.c` as "non-blocking lifecycle for the W2.x synchronous bridge". The earlier card's "46.b (Run state lifecycle for invalid responses end-to-end)" was incorrect — invalid-response handling is already shipped at L1.x through the kernel's `BEFORE-resume` validation clause and is enforced by `S2cCallbackEnvelopeValidationTest` (E89). The card now records that explicitly.
- Introduced **Rule 96 (`kernel_deferred_clause_coherence`)** to enforce the bidirectional link going forward: every `## Rule N.<letter>` in `docs/CLAUDE-deferred.md` requires a literal `Rule N.<letter>` reference in either the CLAUDE.md kernel block OR the matching rule card. The check accepts EITHER surface because rule cards have unlimited length (kernel cards have `kernel_cap`).

### P1-2 — `SkillCapacityRegistry` added to SPI catalog

**Accepted.**

**Action.**
- Added `SkillCapacityRegistry` as the 12th Active SPI row in `docs/contracts/contract-catalog.md` §2; updated the header from "(11 total)" to "(12 total)".
- Added matching tenant-scope row in §"Per-SPI tenant scope" — tenant-scoped via explicit `tenantId` arg on `tryAcquire(tenantId, skillKey)` / `release(tenantId, skillKey)`.
- Cited ADR-0070 / ADR-0080 / ADR-0081 for authority.
- Introduced **Rule 95 (`spi_catalog_exhaustiveness`)**: every public non-sealed `interface` declaration under any `*/spi/*` path must appear in `contract-catalog.md` either as an Active SPI row or with explicit `(internal)` marking. The grep-based check excludes sealed/non-sealed interfaces (the catalog convention classifies sealed types as "Structural carriers", not SPI).

### P1-3 — Deleted-module name truth widened

**Accepted.**

**Action.**
- Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` constraint #59 to use `ascend.springai.service.platform.web.replay`, `…web.trace`, `…web.session` instead of `agent-platform/web/...`, with a historical marker citing ADR-0078.
- Updated `agent-service/src/test/java/.../McpReplaySurfaceArchTest.java` Javadoc to use `agent-service` / `agent-runtime-core` (post-Phase-C) with historical markers.
- Updated `docs/governance/rules/rule-37.md` to use current `agent-service/...platform` and `agent-service/...runtime` paths with historical context for the pre-Phase-C `agent-platform` / `agent-runtime` names.
- Updated `agent-client/ARCHITECTURE.md` lines 48-55 ("Out of scope" + "Forbidden imports") to bracket pre-Phase-C names with post-ADR-0078 / ADR-0079 references.
- Updated `agent-evolve/ARCHITECTURE.md` line 28 (was: "Currently lives in `agent-runtime/evolution/`") with pre-Phase-C / post-ADR-0078 / ADR-0079 context.
- Updated `agent-runtime-core/ARCHITECTURE.md` line 23 cycle-explanation prose to mark `agent-runtime` as pre-Phase-C / historical.
- Introduced **Rule 94 (`active_corpus_deleted_module_name_truth`)** widening Rule 87 from `architecture-status.yaml#allowed_claim` to active `.md`, `.yaml`, and `*.java` files outside `docs/archive/`, `docs/reviews/`, `docs/releases/2026-05-1[0-7]-*.md`, fenced code blocks, and yaml comment lines. Word-boundary regex via POSIX bracket classes (GNU awk doesn't honor `\b`); negative-filter against `agent-runtime-core`; ±3-line marker window. The `forbidden_dependencies` / `Forbidden imports` markers are accepted as exemption keys so legitimate sentinel-list usages (where the deleted module name must appear) pass the gate.

### P1-4 — Rule 89 scope narrowed across surfaces

**Accepted (narrowing path per reviewer's recommendation #1).**

**Action.**
- Updated `docs/governance/enforcers.yaml` E122 `asserts:` to say "every prevention-wave `# Rule N — slug` header (`N >= 80`)" instead of "every `# Rule N — slug` header (full coverage parity)".
- Updated `gate/README.md` line 68 to say "every **prevention-wave Rule** (`N >= 80`) defined in `check_architecture_sync.sh` has at least one `test_rule_<N>_*` function" — pre-rc4 Rules 1-79 explicitly grandfathered.
- The CLAUDE.md Rule 89 kernel + `docs/governance/rules/rule-89.md` card already use the prevention-wave-only definition; rc9 brings the other two surfaces into agreement.

### P2-1 — `gate/rules/` regenerated + non-authoritative

**Accepted.**

**Action.**
- Ran `gate/lib/extract_rules.sh` to refresh `gate/rules/` against the canonical monolith (108 sections after Rules 91-96).
- Rewrote `gate/lib/orchestrator.sh` comments to clearly state: (a) `gate/rules/` is an **IDE-only generated artifact**; (b) the production parallel gate consumes the canonical monolith directly via `check_parallel.sh`; (c) freshness is asserted by Rule 92.
- Introduced **Rule 92 (`gate_rules_corpus_freshness`)** so future drift between canonical and the shadow corpus fails the gate.

## Hidden defect sweep

Family-sweep against H-α/H-β/H-γ/H-δ/H-ε surfaced these additional defects, all closed in rc9:

1. **H-β / Rule 94 hits in module-metadata.yaml** — `agent-bus/module-metadata.yaml` and `agent-client/module-metadata.yaml` listed `agent-platform` / `agent-runtime` in `forbidden_dependencies:` blocks. These are legitimate sentinel values (block future dependencies on deleted module names), but Rule 94 had no exemption for them. **Fix**: `forbidden_dependencies` + `Forbidden imports` added to Rule 94's marker list so the ±3-line window exempts them.
2. **H-β / current-tense prose** — `agent-evolve/ARCHITECTURE.md:28` said "Currently lives in `agent-runtime/evolution/`" — wrong post-ADR-0078 (the module is deleted). `agent-runtime-core/ARCHITECTURE.md:23` cited `agent-runtime` without a historical marker on the cycle-explanation line. Both updated.
3. **H-α / Rule 82 stale phrase mapping** (latent; visible in gate code line 3787) — Rule 82 maps `active engineering rules` → `active_engineering_rules_post_rc6`. After rc8 + rc9 the field name should point at the latest. Deferred to a follow-up wave (low blast radius; the `_post_rc6` snapshot still happens to equal the actual baseline within Rule 82's tolerance for non-rc9 prose lines).
4. **H-δ / Rule 46 sub-clause naming** — The pre-rc9 `docs/governance/rules/rule-46.md` Cross-references section said "46.b (Run state lifecycle for invalid responses end-to-end)". Invalid-response handling is shipped at L1.x; the proper 46.b per `docs/CLAUDE-deferred.md` is capacity wiring. Card rewritten.
5. **GNU awk `\b` doesn't bind word boundary** — early Rule 94 implementation used `\bagent-platform\b`; GNU awk 5.3.2 treated `\b` as literal `b`, silently returning no matches. Fixture parity check caught this. Rewrote to POSIX bracket-class boundary: `(^|[^a-zA-Z0-9_-])agent-platform([^a-zA-Z0-9_-]|$)`. Also applied to the production gate code, not just the self-test fixtures.
6. **gate/rules/ extracts only 100 of 102 sections pre-rc9** — `gate/lib/extract_rules.sh` reported "Extracted 102 rules" but produced 100 files; some sub-rule cases (likely deduplicated by number-only key) silently coalesce. Out of rc9 scope to debug fully (Rule 92 enforces freshness; the 100-vs-108 drift is what Rule 92 surfaces post-rc9). Adding to follow-up plan.

## CI defects bundled in the rc9 wave

Beyond the architecture review, rc9 also closes the CI red trunk that had been failing every push since the repository was created (48 / 50 runs failed):

1. **`NoOpAsyncRunDispatcher`** had `@ConditionalOnMissingBean(AsyncRunDispatcher.class)` on a `@Component` class. The annotation is reliable only on `@Bean` methods inside `@Configuration` — on `@Component` the condition evaluation is order-dependent and on Linux CI the bean was routinely excluded, blocking ~30 Testcontainers integration tests. Removed the annotation; tests already override via `@Primary` in `RunCursorFlowIT.Config`.
2. **`IdempotencyStoreAutoConfiguration#jdbcIdempotencyStore`** carried `@ConditionalOnBean(DataSource.class)` on a regular `@Configuration` class. Spring Boot 4 evaluates that condition before `DataSourceAutoConfiguration` registers the DataSource bean, so the jdbc store silently failed to register — observed in CI as `No qualifying bean of type IdempotencyStore`. Dropped the condition (DataSource is always present in production / Testcontainers; absent DataSource is now an autowire failure, the right shape). Added a Javadoc explaining the Boot 4 ordering hazard.
3. **`WebSecurityConfig`** added `@ConditionalOnWebApplication(type = SERVLET)` so the security filter chain skips registration under `spring.main.web-application-type=none` tests (IdempotencyDurabilityIT + IdempotencyStorePostgresIT no longer fail with missing `HttpSecurity`).
4. **`PostureBindingIT.RunRepositoryFixture`** now provides both `@Bean @Primary RunRepository` AND `@Bean @Primary IdempotencyStore` (the latter built directly from the Testcontainers DataSource). Under `APP_POSTURE=research`, neither bean auto-wires through `RunControllerAutoConfiguration` / `IdempotencyStoreAutoConfiguration` at L1.x; `PostureBootGuard` now sees the durable beans the fixture provides.
5. **Spring AI eager-credential autoconfig** — Spring AI 2.0.0-M5's `OpenAiAudioSpeechAutoConfiguration` (and Anthropic counterparts) instantiate model beans eagerly at context refresh and throw `credential is required, but was not set` when `spring.ai.openai.api-key` / `spring.ai.anthropic.api-key` is absent. Declared dummy placeholders in `agent-service/src/main/resources/application.yml`: `${OPENAI_API_KEY:dummy-no-call-expected}` and `${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:dummy-no-call-expected}`. Real credentials override; absence yields a dummy satisfying bean construction.
6. **`RunResponse` springdoc schema drift** — Spring Boot 4 + Spring AI 2.0.0-M5 + springdoc emits Java record components as optional in the live `/v3/api-docs` spec, drifting from the pinned snapshot's `required: [runId, status, capabilityName, createdAt, updatedAt]`. Annotated each component with `@Schema(requiredMode = REQUIRED)`.

The first green CI run on `main` since rc1 is the evidence backing the rc9 release note's `ci_run:` front-matter (to be inserted after the rc9 push succeeds).

## Verification

| Command | Expected |
|---|---|
| `bash gate/check_parallel.sh` (WSL) | `parallel_summary: executed 108 rules; serial source defined 108 rules` + `GATE: PASS` |
| `bash gate/test_architecture_sync_gate.sh` (WSL) | `Tests passed: 161/161` |
| `python gate/build_architecture_graph.py` | Regenerated nodes/edges; idempotent on second run |
| `./mvnw -B -ntp verify` (CI Linux + Docker) | `BUILD SUCCESS`; 371+ Maven tests GREEN |
| `gh.exe run view <rc9-run-id> --json conclusion` | `"conclusion": "success"` |

## Out of scope (for rc9, deferred)

- Convert `IdempotencyStoreAutoConfiguration` to a true Spring Boot auto-configuration via `META-INF/spring/.../AutoConfiguration.imports` + `@AutoConfigureAfter(DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class)`. The condition drop resolves the immediate CI hazard; the deeper refactor is W2 work.
- Retroactively writing `test_rule_N_*` fixtures for pre-rc4 Rules 1-79 (alternative interpretation of P1-4). rc9 narrows the documented scope to match the kernel + implementation; retroactive fixtures are a W2.x hardening item.
- Rule 90 (`release_note_ci_run_evidence_green`). The intent — that release notes must cite a green CI run on the release SHA — is articulated in ADR-0083 spirit but not yet enforced as a gate rule. Adding it requires a stable `gate/release-ci-evidence/` directory with at least one cached run, which only exists once the first rc9 push is green. Deferred to the next wave.
- Updating `gate/lib/extract_rules.sh` to produce 1-file-per-canonical-header (currently 100 files for 108 headers — sub-rules coalesce by number). Rule 92 enforces the file-vs-header parity; once the rc9 baseline is captured, a follow-up plan fixes the extractor.
- Fixing Rule 82's stale `active_engineering_rules_post_rc6` phrase mapping (latent; not blocking).

# Appendix A — Category-Sweep Follow-Up (rc10 / 2026-05-19)

> **Context**: After rc9 closed all 8 cited findings of the rc8 post-corrective architecture review at their specific surfaces (and CI went green on `main` for the first time since rc1), the user requested a **category-driven re-audit**: group the 8 findings into mechanistic defect families, then sweep each family across the current post-rc9 corpus for hidden defects rc9's prevention rules missed. This appendix documents the rc10 wave that the re-audit produced.

## Family taxonomy

The 8 rc8-cited findings group into 7 mechanistic defect families (I-α … I-η). After running 3 parallel sweeps (Explore agents) + a direct grep audit, **two families** yielded hidden defects rc9's prevention rules missed: **I-α (numeric drift)** and **I-ε (deleted-module-name leakage)**.

| Family | Mechanism | rc9 prevention rule | rc10 hidden defects |
|---|---|---|---|
| I-α | Numeric-claim drift (declared prose ≠ live source) | Rule 91 (only `active_gate_checks`) | 2 hidden (`enforcer_rows` 116 vs 134; rc9 release note 360 nodes / 510 edges) |
| I-β | Orphan authority | Rule 93 + STATE.md archive | Clean (BOM exempt per Rule 78) |
| I-γ | Active kernel overclaims deferred | Rule 96 + Rule 42/46 narrowing | Clean (spot-audit aligns) |
| I-δ | One-direction contract completeness | Rule 95 | Clean (12 SPI rows verified) |
| I-ε | Deleted-module name leakage | Rule 94 (narrow scope) | 7-8 hidden (Helm chart triplet, OpenAPI live + pinned, BoM module-metadata, ops/compose.yml) |
| I-ζ | Multiple authorities disagree | Rule 89 narrowed | Clean (sampled Rules 1-10, 33-48, 80-96) |
| I-η | Shadow corpus described as durable | Rule 92 + orchestrator.sh fix | Clean |

## Hidden defects closed in rc10

### I-α-1 — enforcer_rows declared 116, live count 134 (delta +18)

`docs/governance/architecture-status.yaml:102` declared `enforcer_rows: 116` per the rc9 narrative "rc8 baseline 104 + rc9 wave +12: E123-E134". The live `^- id: E[0-9]+` count in `docs/governance/enforcers.yaml` was actually **134** — an undeclared +18 had accreted across rc7/rc8/rc9 CI defect closure waves. Rule 91 (rc9) narrowly only checked `active_gate_checks`, so the drift was invisible.

**Fix**: update the field to 134 (then to 138 after E135-E138 added in this wave); **strengthen Rule 91 in-place** to additionally enforce `enforcer_rows` against the live `^- id: E[0-9]+` count.

### I-α-2 — rc9 release note declared 360 nodes / 510 edges, actual 369 / 520

`docs/releases/2026-05-19-l0-rc9-corrective.en.md:33` and `:87` declared "360 nodes / 510 edges" with delta "+12 nodes / +24 edges". The live `architecture-graph.yaml#node_count` and `#edge_count` were **369 / 520**, with delta from rc8 baseline (348 / 486) of **+21 / +34**. Both the absolute count AND the delta arithmetic were wrong at rc9 release-note write time. Rule 82 (`baseline_metric_matches_executable_manifest`) doesn't enumerate "nodes" or "edges" in its canonical-key list, so no rule caught the prose drift.

**Fix**: correct both lines in the rc9 release note in place with inline `[rc10 correction: rc9 first cut declared 360 / 510 / +12 / +24]` markers; **add Rule 97 (`release_note_numeric_truth`)** to enforce that the LATEST release note's absolute node/edge claims match live `architecture-graph.yaml` values.

### I-ε family — 7-8 deleted-module-name leaks Rule 94 missed

Rule 94's implementation (`gate/check_architecture_sync.sh:4527-4534`) only scanned **three** surfaces: root `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/governance/rules/*.md` (one-level), and `agent-*/src/test/java/**/*{Test,IT}.java`. The rule body **claimed** "every active `.md`, `.yaml`, and `*.java` file" but explicitly exempted `docs/contracts/openapi-v1.yaml`, `*/src/test/resources/*`, all `docs/adr/*`, and several `docs/` subtrees. The `ops/` directory was NEITHER in the exemption list NOR in the file-discovery scope — Rule 94 silently never scanned it. This **kernel-vs-implementation drift** was itself an undiscovered defect.

The category sweep found 7 hidden leaks Rule 94 missed (plus 1 surfaced by Rule 98 self-validation):

| # | File:Line | Leak |
|---|---|---|
| I-ε-1 | `spring-ai-ascend-dependencies/module-metadata.yaml:9` | BoM description: "pins agent-platform, agent-runtime, ..." |
| I-ε-2 | `ops/helm/spring-ai-ascend/values.yaml:7` | `repository: springaiascend/agent-platform` |
| I-ε-3 | `ops/helm/spring-ai-ascend/templates/deployment.yaml:18` | container `- name: agent-platform` |
| I-ε-4 | `ops/helm/spring-ai-ascend/Chart.yaml:3,9` | description + keyword |
| I-ε-5 | `docs/contracts/openapi-v1.yaml:287` | `x-contract-owner: agent-platform` |
| I-ε-6 | `docs/contracts/openapi-v1.yaml:294` | W1 note: "Integration test: agent-platform RunCursorFlowIT..." |
| I-ε-7 | `agent-service/src/test/resources/contracts/openapi-v1-pinned.yaml:265` | mirrored live `x-contract-owner` |
| I-ε-8 | `ops/compose.yml:1,26` | dev-compose service name (surfaced by Rule 98 self-validation) |

**Fix**: replace `agent-platform` → `agent-service` (and `agent-runtime` → `agent-runtime-core` / post-Phase-C equivalent) in each surface, carrying `post-Phase-C / ADR-0078` markers. **Add Rule 98 (`broad_corpus_deleted_module_name_truth`)** as a sibling to Rule 94 with widened file-discovery scope (`ops/**/*.{yaml,yml,tpl}`, `docs/contracts/*.yaml`, `**/module-metadata.yaml`).

## New prevention gate rules

| # | Slug | Enforcers | Closes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 91 (strengthened) | `baseline_metric_matches_executable_manifest` + `enforcer_rows` sub-check | E123, E124 | I-α-1 |
| 97 | `release_note_numeric_truth` | E135, E136 | I-α-2 |
| 98 | `broad_corpus_deleted_module_name_truth` | E137, E138 | I-ε family |

## Updated baseline counts (rc10)

| Metric | rc9 | rc10 |
|---|---|---|
| Active engineering rules | 51 | 53 (+2) |
| Active gate rules | 108 | 110 (+2) |
| Self-tests | 161 | 165 (+4) |
| Enforcer rows | 116 (declared) / 134 (live) | 138 (live = declared after reconciliation) |
| ADRs | 83 | 84 (+ADR-0084) |
| Architecture graph nodes | 369 | 376 (+7) |
| Architecture graph edges | 520 | 535 (+15) |
