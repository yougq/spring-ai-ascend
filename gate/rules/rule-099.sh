# Rule 99 — kernel_terminal_verb_vs_shipped_decision_check (enforcer E139)
#
# Closes rc10 post-corrective review P1-1 (J-α family): Rule 41 active kernel
# said "over-cap callers are SUSPENDED, not rejected" but the shipped Java
# surface (DefaultSkillResilienceContract.resolve) returns a decision envelope
# (SkillResolution.reject(SuspendReason.RateLimited)), not a Run state
# transition. The actual SUSPENDED transition is W2 orchestrator wiring per
# CLAUDE-deferred.md Rule 41.c.
#
# Rule 99 prevents recurrence by scanning every active #### Rule N kernel
# block in CLAUDE.md for end-state verb tokens (`are SUSPENDED`, `is
# SUSPENDED`, `transitions to FAILED`, `consumes capacity`, `is rejected`,
# `is admitted`). For each match, the rule checks whether CLAUDE-deferred.md
# declares a Rule N.<letter> sub-clause that defers the same behaviour.
# If BOTH (end-state verb in active kernel) AND (deferred sub-clause exists)
# → FAIL — the active kernel is overclaiming shipped behaviour.
#
# This is the SEMANTIC layer Rule 96 doesn't cover. Rule 96 checks the
# literal `Rule N.<letter>` REFERENCE exists; Rule 99 checks the VERBS in
# the kernel match what's actually shipped.
