# gate/lib/check_fact_layer_integrity.py accepts --enforce a,b,c,d to

# Round-4 Wave Alpha (2026-05-28 fourth-correction R3 redesign): the
# byte-identity-to-extractor-re-emission contract (sub-clause .c.bytes)
# moved out of the bash gate and into a Maven Surefire test
# `FactLayerByteIdentityIT` under tools/architecture-workspace, where
# `target/classes` is guaranteed by Maven's compile-phase ordering.
# The bash gate retains structural / provenance / resolver checks
# (sub-clauses .a + .b + .c.structural + .d) which do not require
# compiled classes. This eliminates the precondition-gymnastics that
# bred three rounds of fail-open mechanisms (`|| true`, advisory-skip,
# env-var-opt-in) — there is no longer a "is target/classes present?"
# branch in the bash Rule 131 to be fail-open under.
