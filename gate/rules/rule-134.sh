#
# Phase A Wave 5 (advisory at landing 2026-05-28). Every ADR YAML / rule card /
# enforcer / SAA Feature / contract MUST declare one of: (a) product_claim: with
# a PC-NNN value, (b) governance_infra: true, (c) product_claim_placeholder: true
# (Wave 4 backfill marker). Missing all three = orphan. Counts orphans and emits
# info; doesn't fail unless orphan count exceeds the per-corpus advisory
# threshold (currently 100% -- vacuous-PASS until Wave 4 backfill brings the
# threshold down).
