# Rule 96 — kernel_deferred_clause_coherence (enforcer E133)
#
# Closes rc8 post-corrective review P1-1: active rule kernels (Rule 42, Rule 46)
# stated runtime obligations that `docs/CLAUDE-deferred.md` correctly defers
# to W2. Rule 96 asserts that for every `Rule N.<letter>` block in
# CLAUDE-deferred.md, the matching `#### Rule N` kernel block in CLAUDE.md
# acknowledges the sub-clause by literal-string reference (e.g. `Rule 42.b`).
