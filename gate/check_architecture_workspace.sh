# Wave 1 advisory gate for the Structurizr workspace authority migration.
#
# Authority: ADR-0147 (Structurizr Workspace Authority); plan at
# D:\.claude\plans\structurizr-d-chao-workspace-spring-ai-adaptive-hellman.md.
#
# Wave 1 mode: ADVISORY. The script reports violations but exits 0 even when
# the profile validator finds them. Wave 5 flips this to blocking — the
# script begins to exit non-zero on profile violations or byte-drift in
# the generated zone.
#
# Invocation (run via WSL per Rule G-7):
#   wsl -d Ubuntu -- bash -lc "cd /mnt/d/chao_workspace/spring-ai-ascend && bash gate/check_architecture_workspace.sh"
#
# Or directly inside a Linux/WSL shell:
#   bash gate/check_architecture_workspace.sh
