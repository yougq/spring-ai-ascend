/**
 * In-JVM side-channel carrying the RICH execution outcome (a thrown {@code Throwable} —
 * {@code SuspendSignal} for child-run / S2C suspension, {@code EngineMatchingException}, or
 * any runtime failure) out of the {@code EnginePort} event stream back to the Service driver,
 * keyed by an opaque handle. The neutral {@code AgentEvent} carries only the handle string;
 * the driver retrieves the {@code Throwable} in-JVM and rethrows it, preserving the existing
 * orchestrator suspend/resume + engine_mismatch control flow exactly.
 *
 * <p>The in-process port and the in-JVM mock transports share one instance, so the handle
 * resolves. A real cross-process transport does NOT move the Throwable over the wire — it
 * resolves suspension via the checkpoint-token protocol and reconstructs failure from the
 * FAILED event error-class.
